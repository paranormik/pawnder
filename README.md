- Expo CLI (`npm install -g expo-cli`)
- Xcode (for iOS development)

## Getting Started

   git clone [your-repository-url]
   cd Pawnder
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Copy the example environment file and update it with your configuration:

   Edit the `.env` file with your API keys and other environment-specific settings.

   ```

6. **Run the app**

## Environment Variables

The `.env` file contains your environment-specific configuration. Here's what you need to set up:

```
# API Configuration
API_BASE_URL=your_api_base_url
API_KEY=your_api_key

# App Configuration
APP_NAME=Pawnder
ENVIRONMENT=development

# Optional: Analytics and Monitoring
